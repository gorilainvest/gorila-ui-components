Use whichever is appropriate for your project in the examples below.\nNPM\n\nnpm install --save @gorilainvest/ui-toolkit\nYarn\n\nyarn add @gorilainvest/ui-toolkit\nStep 3: Import the component module\nImport the NgModule for the component you want to use:\n\nimport { EnhancedTitleModule } from '@gorilainvest/ui-toolkit/dist/ui-enhanced-title';\n\n\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    EnhancedTitleModule\n    ...\n  ],\n  ...\n})\nexport class PrimatesPartyPageModule { }Step 4: Use it in your template as you want\nIf you have doubt how to use the component, you can check an interactive example at website.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/contributing.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/contributing.html","title":"additional-page - Contributing","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nContributing to Gorila Invest UI Toolkit\nWe would love for you to contribute to Gorila Invest UI Toolkit and help make it ever better!\nAs a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:\n\nIssues and Bugs\nFeature Requests\nSubmission Guidelines\nCoding Rules\nCommit Message Guidelines\n\n Found an Issue?\nIf you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by\nsubmitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Including an issue \nreproduction (via CodePen, JsBin, Plunkr, etc.) is the absolute best way to help the team quickly\ndiagnose the problem. Screenshots are also helpful.\nYou can help the team even more and submit a Pull Request with a fix.\n Want a Feature?\nYou can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub\nRepository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with\na proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it. \nPlease consider what kind of change it is:\n\nFor a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be\ndiscussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,\nand help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.\nSmall Features can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.\n\n Submitting an Issue\nBefore you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.\nIf your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.\nHelp us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new\nfeatures by not reporting duplicate issues.  Providing the following information will increase the\nchances of your issue being dealt with quickly:\n\nOverview of the Issue - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps\nAngular, Material and Widgets Versions - which versions of Angular, Material and Widget are affected\n  (e.g. 2.0.0-alpha.53)\nMotivation for or Use Case - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior\n  is a bug for you\nBrowsers and Operating System - is this a problem with all browsers?\nReproduce the Error - provide a live example (using CodePen, JsBin,\n  Plunker, etc.) or a unambiguous set of steps\nScreenshots - Due to the visual nature of Gorila Invest UI Toolkit, screenshots can help the team\n  triage issues far more quickly than a text description.\nRelated Issues - has a similar issue been reported before?\nSuggest a Fix - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be\n  causing the problem (line of code or commit)\n\nYou can file new issues by providing the above information here.\n Submitting a Pull Request (PR)\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\nSearch github for an open or closed PR\nthat relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\n\nMake your changes in a new git branch:\n   git checkout -b my-fix-branch master\nCreate your patch, including appropriate test cases.\n\nFollow our Coding Rules.\n\nTest your changes with our supported browsers and screen readers.\n\nRun the full Gorila Invest UI Toolkit test suite, as described in the developer documentation,\nand ensure that all tests pass.\n\nCommit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our\ncommit message conventions. Adherence to these conventions\nis necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.\n   git commit -aNote: the optional commit -a command line option will automatically \"add\" and \"rm\" edited files.\n\n\n\nPush your branch to Github:\n\n```shell\ngit push my-fork my-fix-branch\n```\nIn Github, send a pull request to material2:master.\n\nIf we suggest changes then:\n\nMake the required updates.\n\nRe-run the Gorila Invest UI Toolkit test suites to ensure tests are still passing.\n\nRebase your branch and force push to your Github repository (this will update your Pull\nRequest):\ngit rebase master -i\ngit push -f\n\n\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution!\nAfter your pull request is merged\nAfter your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes\nfrom the main (upstream) repository:\n\nDelete the remote branch on Github either through the Github web UI or your local shell as\n  follows:\n  git push my-fork --delete my-fix-branch\nCheck out the master branch:\n  git checkout master -f\nDelete the local branch:\n  git branch -D my-fix-branch\nUpdate your master with the latest upstream version:\n  git pull --ff upstream master\n\n Coding Rules\nTo ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:\n\nAll features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).\nAll public API methods must be documented. (Details TBD).\nWe follow Angular Style Guide.\n\n Commit Message Guidelines\nWe have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to more\nreadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.  But also,\nwe use the git commit messages to generate the Gorila Invest UI Toolkit change log.\nCommit Message Format\nEach commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer.  The header has a special\nformat that includes a type, a scope and a subject:\n(): \n\n\n\nThe header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.\nAny line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier\nto read on Github as well as in various git tools.\nRevert\nIf the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert:, followed by the header of\nthe reverted commit. In the body it should say: This reverts commit ., where the hash is\nthe SHA of the commit being reverted.\nType\nMust be one of the following:\n\nfeat: A new feature\nfix: A bug fix\ndocs: Documentation only changes\nstyle: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing\nsemi-colons, etc)\nrefactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\nperf: A code change that improves performance\ntest: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\nbuild: Changes that affect the build system, CI configuration or external dependencies      (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)\nchore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files\n\nScope\nThe scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example\ndatepicker, dialog, etc.\nSubject\nThe subject contains succinct description of the change:\n\nuse the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\"\ndon't capitalize first letter\nno dot (.) at the end\n\nBody\nJust as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\".\nThe body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.\nFooter\nThe footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to\nreference Github issues that this commit Closes.\nBreaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines.\nThe rest of the commit message is then used for this.\nA detailed explanation can be found in this document.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/dev-environment.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/dev-environment.html","title":"additional-page - Dev Environment","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nDeveloper guide: getting your environment set up\n\nMake sure you have node installed with a version at least 8.0.0 and yarn with a version\nof at least 1.10.0. We recommend using nvm to manage your node versions.\n\nRun yarn global add gulp to install gulp.\n\nFork the gorilainvest/gorila-ui-components repo on Github.\n\nClone your fork to your machine with git clone.\nRecommendation: name your git remotes upstream for gorilainvest/gorila-ui-components\nand  for your fork.\n\nFrom the root of the project, run yarn or npm install.\n\n\nTo build UI Toolkit in dev mode, run ng build.\nTo build UI Toolkit in release mode, run ng build --prod\nTo bring up a local server, run npm start. This will automatically watch for changes\nand rebuild. The browser should refresh automatically when changes are made.\nRunning tests\nTo run unit tests, run npm run test.\nTo run the e2e tests, run npm run e2e.\nTo run lint, run npm run lint.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
